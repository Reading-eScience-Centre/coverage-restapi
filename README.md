# Coverage Data REST API

(Work-in-progress)

A lightweight REST API for serving coverage data.
In its simplest form there is no need for a custom server implementation.
Advanced functionality like filtering, subsetting, or paging is added seamlessly.

This API specification is meant for the web and embraces its principles.
It is an alternative to existing/historically grown APIs like [WCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Coverage_Service). 

[The specification](spec.md) is currently in active development.
